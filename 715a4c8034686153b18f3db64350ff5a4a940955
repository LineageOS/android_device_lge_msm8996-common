      "message": "I\u0027m wondering whether I should remove these two lines.  These will only function to detect if /persist/.macaddr and /persist/.baddr still have mode 0600; and I am unsure whether this situation is a problem.  `hwaddrs` is the only program I\u0027m aware of which uses these files, so having a restrictive mode isn\u0027t a problem.\n\nProblems with the mode of /data/misc/wifi/config and /data/misc/bluetooth/bdaddr will be detected above due to open() giving EPERM.",
