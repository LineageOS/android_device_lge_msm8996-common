      "message": "Hmm.. just noticing now, line 32 and this conflict in the logic for 132/133 (and 141/142).  I realize this is just the /persist on, but line 32 adjusts for both persist and /data locations.  So it will keep flip-flopping permissions.  Also line 125 will put it back yet again. \n\nYou might need to adjust 67 too to match, as it open\u0027s with different permissions than S_IWGRP.\n\nHowever.... line 49 should prevent all 00\u0027s from getting into the addr anyways.  So if that does occur, then someone might have done it to themself.. ;)",
