      "message": "If you go to an engineering school, read(fd, buf, 1) is actually one of the things you\u0027ll learn about in your Operating Systems class.  Do not ever do this.  read()/write() are system calls and you\u0027ll have horrible performance if you don\u0027t buffer.  If you want bytes one at a time, use fdopen(fd, mode) plus fgetc()/fputc() and let libc take care of buffering for you.\n\nAdditionally, \"\u0026macbytes[i]\" is exactly equivalent to \"macbytes+i\".\n\nThis was fine for an initial experiment, but I cringe at this having survived this long.",
